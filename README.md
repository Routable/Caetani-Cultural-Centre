# Project Description
Caetani Cultural Center requires a way to showcase physical items such as artifacts and other exhibits in a digital format. The system would display this digital content using a web browser to the user’s phone or tablet, which is directly accessed by the user by scanning QR codes that are found near the exhibit(s). 

# Project Purpose & Scope
The primary objective of this project is to provide the necessary tools for Caetani Cultural Center staff members to add, and edit digital exhibits that can then be viewed by phone/tablet users who are visiting the museum. These tools will allow the Caetani staff to easily create and edit exhibit pages with little technical know-how. In addition, the ability to generate a QR code will be provided, which can be provided to users to access the exhibit pages.

# Timeline
Review of Project Requirements – January 19th, 2018
Initial System Prototype (Beta) – February 28th
User Testing, Final Changes– March 16th to April 26th 
Project Completion Date - April 26th, 2018

# Requirements
 
1)	Users can use their own QR application to scan codes to access digital exhibit information.

2)	Users should be able to easily access information about the artifact(s) after scanning.

3)	Staff users should be able to easily add, or update artifact/exhibit pages, in a non-complicated manner.

4)	Staff users should be able to easily view analytic details showing the most popular QR codes.

# Optional Requirements

1)	Voucher system to allow users to access certain content, which will expire after a set duration of time. This will need to be confirmed by the client, as making content public (eg. YouTube) may be more beneficial in the long run. 

2)	If possible, investigate current security concerns on the Caetani website and resolve them.

3)	System to provide references to similar pages based on the currently viewed exhibit page, ie. tags.
